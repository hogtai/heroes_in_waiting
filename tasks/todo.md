- [ ] Implement getContentVersions (with pagination and filtering)  
- [ ] Implement getContentVersion (single version retrieval)
- [ ] Implement createContentVersion (with content sanitization)
- [ ] Implement updateContentVersion (with content sanitization)
- [ ] Implement deleteContentVersion (soft delete functionality)

### Phase 2: Media File Management
- [ ] Implement uploadMediaFile (with file validation and security)
- [ ] Implement getMediaFiles (with filtering and pagination)
- [ ] Implement getMediaFile (single file retrieval)
- [ ] Implement deleteMediaFile (with cleanup)

### Phase 3: Content Approval Workflow
