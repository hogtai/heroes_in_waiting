# Task 1.1: Create Classroom Creation Screen Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement the CreateClassroomScreen.kt following exact patterns from FacilitatorDashboardScreen.kt, including form validation, state management, and integration with existing ClassroomRepository.

## Analysis Summary
After examining the existing codebase, I've identified the following key patterns and architecture:

### Existing Patterns:
1. **Screen Structure**: Uses Scaffold with TopAppBar, LazyColumn content, loading/error states
2. **UI Components**: HeroesCard for containers, HeroesTextField for inputs, HeroesPrimaryButton for actions
3. **ViewModel Pattern**: StateFlow for reactive state, events for navigation, repository integration
4. **Navigation**: Screen object with route definitions, event-driven navigation
5. **Repository Integration**: ClassroomRepository.createClassroom() already exists
6. **Form Validation**: Error states with proper error handling

### Key Files Analyzed:
- FacilitatorDashboardScreen.kt - Screen structure and UI patterns
- FacilitatorDashboardViewModel.kt - State management and repository integration  
- HeroesComponents.kt - UI component library
- Screen.kt - Navigation routing
- ClassroomRepository.kt - Data layer with createClassroom method
- Classroom.kt - Domain models and Grade enum

## Implementation Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Create CreateClassroomViewModel.kt
- [ ] Create ViewModel following FacilitatorDashboardViewModel patterns
- [ ] Implement StateFlow for UI state management
- [ ] Add form validation logic for name, description, grade, capacity
- [ ] Integrate with ClassroomRepository.createClassroom()
- [ ] Handle loading, success, and error states
- [ ] Implement navigation events

### ✅ Task 2: Create CreateClassroomScreen.kt
- [ ] Create screen following FacilitatorDashboardScreen structure
- [ ] Use Scaffold with TopAppBar and back navigation
- [ ] Implement form with HeroesCard layout
- [ ] Add form fields: classroom name, description, grade dropdown, capacity
- [ ] Include Heroes in Waiting curriculum selection
- [ ] Use HeroesPrimaryButton for form submission
- [ ] Handle loading/error states with proper UI feedback

### ✅ Task 3: Update Navigation
- [ ] Verify CreateClassroom route exists in Screen.kt
- [ ] Configure navigation in MainActivity routing
- [ ] Test navigation from FacilitatorDashboard to CreateClassroom

### ✅ Task 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test form validation with various inputs
- [ ] Test successful classroom creation flow
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify navigation back to dashboard after creation
- [ ] Test UI components and responsive design

## Technical Requirements

### Form Fields:
1. **Classroom Name** (Required)
   - HeroesTextField with validation
   - Max 100 characters
   - Error state for empty/invalid names

2. **Description** (Optional)
   - HeroesTextField multiline
   - Max 500 characters

3. **Grade Level** (Required)
   - Dropdown with Grade.GRADE_4, Grade.GRADE_5, Grade.GRADE_6
   - Uses existing Grade enum

4. **Student Capacity** (Required)
   - Number input with default 30
   - Range: 1-50 students
   - Validation for numeric input

5. **Curriculum Selection** (Required)
   - Fixed to "Heroes in Waiting" for now
   - Display as read-only text with description

### State Management:
- Loading state during creation
- Form validation errors
- Success/failure feedback
- Navigation events

### COPPA Compliance:
- No student data collection in classroom creation
- Form focuses on facilitator settings only
- Privacy-conscious data handling

## Expected Deliverable
Working create classroom screen that:
- Follows exact UI/UX patterns from existing dashboard
- Integrates seamlessly with existing navigation
- Uses established UI components and theme
- Creates classrooms via ClassroomRepository
- Provides proper validation and error handling
- Maintains COPPA compliance

## Review Criteria
- [ ] UI matches existing design patterns exactly
- [ ] Form validation works correctly
- [ ] Integration with repository successful
- [ ] Navigation flows work properly
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Code follows existing architectural patterns
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Next Steps**: Await approval of this plan before beginning implementation.
