# CreateClassroomViewModel Implementation Plan

## Analysis of Existing Patterns

Based on reading the existing codebase:
- **Package structure**: `com.lifechurch.heroesinwaiting.presentation.viewmodel`
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with StateFlow-based reactive state management
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt with `@HiltViewModel` annotation
- **Repository method**: `ClassroomRepository.createClassroom(name, description, grade, maxStudents)` returns `Result<Classroom>`
- **Data models**: `Classroom`, `Grade` enum (GRADE_4, GRADE_5, GRADE_6, OTHER)
- **Error handling**: Using Result.fold() pattern with proper UI state updates

## Implementation Plan

### TODO Items:

- [x] **Create CreateClassroomViewModel.kt** following FacilitatorDashboardViewModel patterns
  - StateFlow-based UI state management
  - Hilt dependency injection with ClassroomRepository
  - Form validation for all required fields
  - Integration with ClassroomRepository.createClassroom()
  - Proper error handling and loading states
  - Navigation events after successful creation

- [x] **Implement form state management** for:
  - name (String, required, max 100 characters)
  - description (String?, optional)
  - grade (Grade enum, required)
  - capacity/maxStudents (Int, default 30, range 1-50)
  - curriculum (not in current data model, may need to be added later)

- [x] **Add form validation** with:
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Field-specific error messages
  - Form submission validation
  - Clear validation state management

- [x] **Implement proper state management**:
  - Loading states during creation
  - Success/error states
  - Form field states
  - Navigation events

- [x] **Add utility methods** for:
  - Form validation
  - Error handling
  - State management helpers

## Architecture Decisions
1. Follow exact patterns from FacilitatorDashboardViewModel
2. Use StateFlow for reactive state management
3. Implement proper error handling with Result pattern
4. Use Hilt for dependency injection
5. Maintain clean separation of concerns
6. Follow existing naming conventions and code style

## Review

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented `CreateClassroomViewModel.kt` following the established patterns in the codebase:

**âœ… Key Features Implemented:**
- **StateFlow-based Reactive State Management**: All form fields and UI states use StateFlow for reactive updates
- **Comprehensive Form Validation**: Real-time validation for name, description, grade, and capacity with specific error messages
- **Repository Integration**: Proper integration with `ClassroomRepository.createClassroom()` method
- **Error Handling**: Following the Result.fold() pattern used throughout the codebase
- **Navigation Events**: Emits events for successful creation and navigation back
- **Utility Methods**: Helper methods for validation, form management, and state handling

**ðŸ“‹ Form Fields Implemented:**
- `name`: Required string field with 100 character limit validation
- `description`: Optional string field with 500 character limit validation  
- `grade`: Required Grade enum selection from available options
- `capacity`: Integer field with range validation (1-50 students, default 30)

**ðŸ”„ State Management:**
- Reactive form validation using `combine()` operator
- Separate StateFlow for each form field and validation error
- Loading states during classroom creation
- Computed `isFormValid` property that automatically updates
- Clean error and form reset functionality

**ðŸŽ¯ Architecture Compliance:**
- Uses `@HiltViewModel` annotation for dependency injection
- Follows exact package structure: `com.lifechurch.heroesinwaiting.presentation.viewmodel`
- Implements proper error handling patterns matching existing ViewModels
- Uses SharedFlow for one-time events (navigation, success)
- Maintains clean separation between UI state and business logic

**ðŸš€ Additional Features:**
- Form change detection for unsaved changes warning
- Helper methods for grade options and capacity ranges
- Comprehensive field validation with user-friendly error messages
- Support for form reset and error clearing

The implementation is production-ready and seamlessly integrates with the existing architecture while providing a robust foundation for the Create Classroom UI screen.
