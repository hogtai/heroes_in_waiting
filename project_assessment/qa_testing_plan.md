#### App Performance - Firebase Performance Monitoring
```kotlin
// Performance monitoring integration
class PerformanceMonitor {
    fun trackScreenTransition(screenName: String) {
        val trace = FirebasePerformance.getInstance().newTrace("screen_$screenName")
        trace.start()
        // Track screen loading time
        trace.stop()
    }
    
    fun trackApiCall(endpoint: String) {
        val trace = FirebasePerformance.getInstance().newTrace("api_$endpoint")
        trace.start()
        // Track API response time
        trace.stop()
    }
}
```

### Test Data Management

#### Test Database Setup
```sql
-- Test data creation script
INSERT INTO facilitators (email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, organization) 
VALUES ('test@heroesinwaiting.com', 'hashed_password', 'Test', 'Facilitator', 'Test School');

INSERT INTO classrooms (facilitator_id, name, classroom_code, grade_level) 
VALUES ((SELECT id FROM facilitators WHERE email = 'test@heroesinwaiting.com'), 'Test Classroom', 'TEST1234', 5);
```

#### Mock Data Services
```kotlin
// Mock data for testing
object TestDataFactory {
    fun createMockFacilitator() = Facilitator(
        id = "test-id",
        email = "test@example.com",
        firstName = "Test",
        lastName = "Teacher",
        organization = "Test School"
    )
    
    fun createMockClassroom() = Classroom(
        id = "classroom-id",
        name = "Grade 5 Heroes",
        code = "ABC12345",
        gradeLevel = 5
    )
}
```
